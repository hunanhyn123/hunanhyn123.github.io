<b> Currently, we are working on a variety of crops (Tobacco, Maize) and model plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, wild Nicotiana plants) with particular focus on:</b> 

* Evolution and adaptation of complex traits in response to natural and artificial selection

  * Genetic architecture of complex traits
  * Impact of environment on complex traits variation and evolution
  * Molecular basis underlying complex traits
  * Predictive models for various breeding setup


* Development of wet-lab protocol and computational methods 

  * Low coverage genotyping and imputation
  * High throughput and cost-efficient omics approaches
  * Development of SNP array for various breeding applications
  * Raspberry PI and UAV powered plant phenotyping
  
* Towards a productive and sustainable solution for future agriculture and biodiversity conservation
 
  * Integrating of remote sensing, climate and soil modelling in plant genetics and ecology
  * Predicting the future of natural and artificial population
  * Systemic design of future agriculture and biodiversity
