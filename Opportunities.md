## Join the lab
We are </b>always<b> looking for talented new group members, from <b>guest project students</b> to <b>Masters, PhD candiates, Postdocs and Lab technicians</b>. Backgrounds vary widely, from <b>molecular biology to mathmatics, statistics, bioinformatics and computer sciences.</b> 
  
We are working on a <b>multidisciplinary</b> filed reqruies constant update of knowledge and skills from all releated subjects, I firmly believe that the <b>future of science and instrutry</b> requires talents <b>tailored around solving a particular problem</b> rather than being expert in a narrow field without knowledge in releated fileds.

Therefore, I personally <b>do not</b> require new members to know everything before they join our lab but I expect everyone is prepared to learn the necessary knowledge and skills to collect, analyse and interpret their own data, and eventually <b>become a well-trained scientist or industry partner</b> at the end of their journey in our lab. <b>Passion</b> about the scienfic problem that we are adressing and <b>courage</b> to step out of their comfort zone, <b>willness to challange </b>themself with new ideas and skills, <b>respectfulness</b> are four key characters that we value the most. 

## Collaborating with us

We are a group of geneticists and data science geeks who are <b>always</b> eager to <b>collaborate with you</b>, no matter you are a <b>web-lab scientist, computational scientist or a industry partners</b>.
Our expertise covers:
* Bioinformatics
