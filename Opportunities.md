## Join the lab
We are always looking for talented new group members, from project students to Masters, PhD candiates, Postdocs and Lab technicians. Backgrounds vary widely, from molecular biology to mathmatics, statistics, bioinformatics and computer sciences. We are working on a multidisplinary filed reqruies constant update of knowledge and skills from all releated subjects, I firmly believe that the future of science and instrutry requires talents tailored around solving a particular problem rather than being expert in a narrow field without knowledge in releated fileds. Therefore, I personally do not require new members to know everything before they join our lab but I expect everyone is prepared to learn the necessary knowledge and skills to collect, analyse and interpret their own data, and eventually become a well-trained scientist or industry partner at the end of their journey in our lab. Passion about the scienfic problem that we are adressing and courage to step out of their comfort zone, willness to challange themself with new ideas and skills, respectfulness are four the key characters that we value the most.
