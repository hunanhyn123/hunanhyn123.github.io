We are a research group at . Our mission is to <b>provide a productive and sustainable strategy</b> for future <b>agriculture and biodiversity conservation</b> empowered by recent developments in genetics, genomics, ecology and data science.

<b>Agriculture and biodiversity conservation</b> sectors are facing increasing threat more than ever from extreme weather conidiations associated with <b>climate change and booming population</b>. Our group is committed to:

* <b>Understanding the interplay between environment, plants (both wild populations and crops) and their impact on future agriculture and biodiversity</b> by studying the genetic regulation and adaptation of adaptive traits (yield, heterosis, photoperiod, draught and heat resistance).  
* <b>Developing cutting-edge technologies to help implement a productive and sustainable strategy in future agriculture and biodiversity conservation projects</b> by integrating recent advances in genetics, genomics, remote sensing, computer vision and data science.
