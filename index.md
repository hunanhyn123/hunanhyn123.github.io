We are a computational biology research group at . Our mission is to <b> provide a productive and sustainable strategy</b> for future <b>agriculture and biodiversity conservation</b> empowered by recent developments in genetics, genomics, ecology and data science.

Our group is committed to:

* <b>Understanding the interplay between environment, plants (both wild populations and crops) and their impact on future agriculture and biodiversity</b> by studying the genetic regulation and adaptation of adaptive traits (yield, heterosis, photoperiod, draught and heat resistance). Interests include dissecting the genetic basis of adaptive traits, understanding the process of adaptive traits evolution in response to changing environmental cues, examining how genetic diversity is partitioned genetically and distributed geographically along a long timescale, and developing new strategies for recombining genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) to enhance plant performance in agriculture and biodiversity conservation.

* <b>Developing cutting-edge technologies to help implement a productive and sustainable strategy in future agriculture and biodiversity conservation projects</b> by integrating recent advances in genetics, genomics, remote sensing, computer vision and data science. Interests include optimising developments in remote sensing, computer vision and data science to efficiently aquire morphological and physiological phenotypes both in greenhouse condition and feild plantations, and developing computational methods to implement these developments and recent advancs in genetics into a sustainable strategy in future agriculture and biodiversity conservation projects.
