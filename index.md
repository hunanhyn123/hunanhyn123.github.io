We are a research group at . Our mission is to provide a productive and sustainable strategy for future agriculture and biodiversity conservation empowered by recent developments in genetics, genomics, ecology and data science.\

Agriculture and biodiversity conservation sectors are facing increasing threat more than ever from extreme weather conidiations associated with climate change and booming population. Our group is committed to:

* Understanding the interplay between environment, plants (both wild populations and crops) and their impact on future agriculture and biodiversity by studying the genetic regulation and adaptation of adaptive traits (yield, heterosis, photoperiod, draught and heat resistance).  
* Developing cutting-edge technologies to help implement a productive and sustainable strategy in future agriculture and biodiversity conservation projects by integrating recent advances in genetics, genomics, remote sensing, computer vision and data science.
